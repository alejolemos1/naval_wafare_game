We have 3 type of ships (Destroyer size 2, Submarine size 3 and Battleship size 4), first, we need to place theese ships on the map (whick have 8x8 boxes), for example, Destroyer in 3.3 vertical, Submarine in 2.3 horizontal and Battleship in 1.2 horizontal. The map will look like this:

Each player have to do this.

Then, each player will attack with each ship, each one at their turn, for example:

This will continue until one player runs out of ships, in case of a tie the game will restart.
